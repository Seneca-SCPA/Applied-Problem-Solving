# Glossary of Key Terms

**Construct**
: A logical control such as a selection or iteration.

**Enumeration**
: Sequencing steps with an identifier such as a number (ex: 1. 2. 3. ...) or letter (ex: A. B. C. ...).
: Used primarily in pseudo code to identify the execution sequence of statements.

**Indentation**
: A fixed number of blank spaces to the right (ex: using the `TAB` key) used for aligning grouped logic that is nested.

**Iteration**
: A construct that enables looping in a program - the ability to repeat a statement(s) easily.

**Jump Statements**
: A poor logic flow that directs the next step of execution be an arbitrary location outside of the immediate vicinity of the current statement (ex: go to step #152). Instead, logic should be controlled using logical constructs such as selection and iteration.

**Modularity**
: A term used for breaking down logic into various degrees of detail. This can be at a directory-level, file-level, function-level, or statement-level.

**Nest**
: Content (statement(s), selection, or iteration) residing within a preceding construct such as a selection or iteration.
: The nested content would be dependant on a preceding construct and in the case of pseudo code would be indented under it.

**Obfuscate**
: To purposely confuse and misdirect meaning usually by way of applying meaningless names to variables and functions.

**Selection**
: A construct that enables decisions in a program to adapt to changing conditions and execute different logic flows.

**Semantic**
: Is another word for logic. It is the logical definition and meaning of an algorithm.

**Statement**
: A single line of instruction (step) such as a calculation, action to display or receive user input.

**Variable**
: A named placeholder used to reference a value. These are used for storing data for later use and evaluation.
